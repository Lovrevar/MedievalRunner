As I reached the final stages of this development period, I decided to introduce new features to enhance the gameplay. One major addition was the introduction of elixirs. These elixirs spawn randomly every tenth tile and provide various boosts. The green elixir doubles the coins collected, offering players an incentive to explore and collect as many coins as possible. The red elixir saves the player from one cannon shot, adding a strategic element to the game.

Setting up these elixirs involved writing complex scripts to handle their spawning and effects. Balancing their frequency and impact was crucial to ensure they added value without disrupting the game's balance. The meticulous process was worth it, as the elixirs added a new layer of depth to the gameplay, making it more engaging and dynamic.

During this period, I also spent considerable time at university, working on integrating arcade machine controls. This experience presented a unique set of challenges as I had to understand the intricacies of hardware integration and adapt the game's controls accordingly. The steep learning curve was daunting, but the satisfaction of seeing the game run on an arcade machine was immense.

To further complicate the game, I added cannons that shoot randomly at intervals of 1-3 seconds. This brought a new level of difficulty and excitement to the gameplay. I also created eight additional tiles, giving players the option to choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Impossible. Each level offers a unique set of challenges, with varying numbers of lanes and cannons. Easy mode is relatively straightforward with three lanes and no cannons. Normal mode introduces more cannons and five lanes, while Impossible mode is extremely challenging with at least two cannons per tile and only three lanes. This mode requires players to rely heavily on luck and skill to achieve a high score.

Another significant addition was the coin collection system. I implemented a system that tracks the coins collected during gameplay and displays the total score at the end of each run. This added a competitive element, encouraging players to improve their scores and beat their previous records.

Overall, this period was incredibly productive and fulfilling. I learned a lot about game development and overcame numerous challenges. Each new feature and improvement brought the game closer to its final form. The journey is still ongoing, but the progress so far has been immensely rewarding.
