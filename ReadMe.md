Game Controls
Move Player Left and Right
To navigate your character through the bustling medieval streets, use the joystick. Shifting the joystick left or right will move your player accordingly. This movement is crucial for dodging obstacles, collecting coins, and maintaining your momentum as you sprint through the endless town.

Select Button
The green button serves as your select button. Whether you're navigating menus or making in-game selections, the green button is your go-to for confirming choices and actions. It’s designed to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring that you can quickly make decisions without interrupting the flow of the game.

Pause Button
If you need to take a break or adjust your settings, the red button will pause the game. This brings up the pause menu, where you can restart the level, change difficulty levels, or exit. It's a handy feature for moments when you need to catch your breath or rethink your strategy.

Navigate Through Buttons
Navigating through the game’s menus and options is straightforward with the joystick. Shift the joystick to move through the buttons and menu options, allowing you to select different settings and configurations easily. This control scheme ensures that all menu navigation is smooth and intuitive.

Elixirs
Elixirs are special items that spawn in the game, providing powerful boosts to aid your journey through the medieval town. These elixirs spawn exclusively on the "Normal" difficulty level, adding an extra layer of strategy and excitement.

Red Elixir
The red elixir appears every tenth time the second tile is initialized. When you collect this elixir, it grants your player a shield that protects against one cannon shot. This can be a lifesaver, especially in moments when the game gets particularly intense with multiple obstacles and cannon fire.

Green Elixir
The green elixir spawns every tenth time the third tile is initialized. Upon collection, this elixir provides a 2x coin multiplier for 30 seconds. This temporary boost allows you to double the value of every coin you collect during this period, significantly increasing your score and enhancing your chances of setting a new high score.

Cannons
Cannons add a thrilling and challenging element to the game. They become active the moment your player steps onto a tile with a cannon. These cannons fire at intervals ranging between 1 to 3 seconds, requiring you to stay on your toes and react quickly to avoid getting hit.

Some cannons are cleverly hidden within the environment, adding an element of surprise and requiring sharp observation skills. The randomness of the firing intervals means that each encounter with a cannon is unpredictable, keeping the gameplay dynamic and engaging.

Endless Gameplay
Medieval Runner is designed as an endless runner, meaning there is no final level or ultimate goal beyond running as far as you can. The game continues indefinitely, presenting new challenges and obstacles the further you go. Your primary objective is to avoid obstacles, collect coins, and utilize power-ups to extend your run for as long as possible.

The endless nature of the game ensures that each playthrough is unique. No two runs are the same, thanks to the random generation of tiles, obstacles, and elixirs. This keeps the game fresh and replayable, offering a continuous challenge for players seeking to beat their high scores.

Conclusion
In Medieval Runner, you run until you can't anymore. The thrill of the chase, the joy of collecting coins, and the excitement of dodging obstacles make every run an adventure. With intuitive controls, strategic power-ups, and challenging cannons, the game offers endless hours of fun and excitement. So grab the joystick, press that green button, and dive into the lively world of Medieval Runner. Good luck, and may your runs be long and prosperous!
